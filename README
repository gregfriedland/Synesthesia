This repository contains the Arduino and Processing sketches used in the syneseizure project (syneseizure.wordpress.com) created as part of Science Hack Day San Francisco 2011. Syneseizure is project to use a physical device to create the effect of synesthesia experienced by some people, by translating vision into touch. The hardware is a mask with 12 speakers built into it in a 4x3 array controlled by an Arduino. The Arduino is connected to a computer running a Processing sketch that takes input from a webcam, simplifies it into a 4x3 pixel array and sends the data to the mask, which vibrates in response to the visual input.

The Arduino code uses square wave generation in software to control frequencies on the 12 speakers at once on different Arduino pins. The code for this is available here: https://github.com/gregfriedland/SoftwareTone.
